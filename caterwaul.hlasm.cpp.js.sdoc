Introduction.
This module exists to generate C++ from high-level assembly definitions. It wouldn't be used much in production; it's primarily useful for me to debug stuff. Something useful may end up coming
out of it though. If you let a Javascript program run in interpreted mode for some time, you can take the collected traces and emit specialized code for them. It's theoretically possible to
leverage this to generate performant C++ for a given Javascript workflow.
